How to access data in Matrix or Grid
Like one-dimensional arrays, matrices can be accessed randomly by using their indices to access the individual elements. A cell has two indices, one for its row number, and the other for its column number. We can use X[i][j] to access the element which is at the ith row and jth column of the matrix.
int arr[4][3]={1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 20, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120};

The syntax for access element from the matrix which is at the ith row and jth column:

int value = X[i][j];
